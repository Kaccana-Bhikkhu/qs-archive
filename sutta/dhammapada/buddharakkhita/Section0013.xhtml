  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-167"></a><small>167.</small>&nbsp;Follow not the vulgar way; live not in heedlessness; hold not false views; linger not long in worldly existence.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-168"></a><small>168.</small>&nbsp;Arise! Do not be heedless! Lead a righteous life. The righteous live happily both in this world and the next.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-169"></a><small>169.</small>&nbsp;Lead a righteous life; lead not a base life. The righteous live happily both in this world and the next.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-170"></a><small>170.</small>&nbsp;One who looks upon the world as a bubble and a mirage, him the King of Death sees not.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-171"></a><small>171.</small>&nbsp;Come! Behold this world, which is like a decorated royal chariot. Here fools flounder, but the wise have no attachment to it.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-172"></a><small>172.</small>&nbsp;He who having been heedless is heedless no more, illuminates this world like the moon freed from clouds.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-173"></a><small>173.</small>&nbsp;He, who by good deeds covers the evil he has done, illuminates this world like the moon freed from clouds.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-174"></a><small>174.</small>&nbsp;Blind is the world; here only a few possess insight. Only a few, like birds escaping from the net, go to realms of bliss.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-175"></a><small>175.</small>&nbsp;Swans fly on the path of the sun; men pass through the air by psychic powers; the wise are led away from the world after vanquishing Māra and his host.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-176"></a><small>176.</small>&nbsp;For a liar who has violated the one law (of truthfulness) who holds in scorn the hereafter, there is no evil that he cannot do.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-177"></a><small>177.</small>&nbsp;Truly, misers fare not to heavenly realms; nor, indeed, do fools praise generosity. But the wise man rejoices in giving, and by that alone does he become happy hereafter.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-178"></a><small>178.</small>&nbsp;Better than sole sovereignty over the earth, better than going to heaven, better even than lordship over all the worlds is the supramundane Fruition of Stream Entrance.<sup><a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn-15">15</a></sup></p>
