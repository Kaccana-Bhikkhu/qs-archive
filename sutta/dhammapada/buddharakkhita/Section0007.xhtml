  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-90"></a><small>90.</small>&nbsp;The fever of passion exists not for him who has completed the journey, who is sorrowless and wholly set free, and has broken all ties.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-91"></a><small>91.</small>&nbsp;The mindful ones exert themselves. They are not attached to any home; like swans that abandon the lake, they leave home after home behind.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-92"></a><small>92.</small>&nbsp;Those who do not accumulate and are wise regarding food, whose object is the Void, the Unconditioned Freedom — their track cannot be traced, like that of birds in the air.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-93"></a><small>93.</small>&nbsp;He whose cankers are destroyed and who is not attached to food, whose object is the Void, the Unconditioned Freedom — his path cannot be traced, like that of birds in the air.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-94"></a><small>94.</small>&nbsp;Even the gods hold dear the wise one, whose senses are subdued like horses well trained by a charioteer, whose pride is destroyed and who is free from the cankers.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-95"></a><small>95.</small>&nbsp;There is no more worldly existence for the wise one who, like the earth, resents nothing, who is firm as a high pillar and as pure as a deep pool free from mud.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-96"></a><small>96.</small>&nbsp;Calm is his thought, calm his speech, and calm his deed, who, truly knowing, is wholly freed, perfectly tranquil and wise.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-97"></a><small>97.</small>&nbsp;The man who is without blind faith, who knows the Uncreated, who has severed all links, destroyed all causes (for karma, good and evil), and thrown out all desires — he, truly, is the most excellent of men.<sup><a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn-11">11</a></sup></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-98"></a><small>98.</small>&nbsp;Inspiring, indeed, is that place where Arahants dwell, be it a village, a forest, a vale, or a hill.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-99"></a><small>99.</small>&nbsp;Inspiring are the forests in which worldlings find no pleasure. There the passionless will rejoice, for they seek no sensual pleasures.</p>
