  <h2 id="heading_id_18" title="17. Kodhavagga: Anger (221-234)"><small>17.</small> Kodhavagga: <i>Anger</i></h2>

  <p class="sgc-2"><img alt="" src="../Images/sun.png" /><br /></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-221"></a><small>221.</small>&nbsp;One should give up anger, renounce pride, and overcome all fetters. Suffering never befalls him who clings not to mind and body and is detached.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-222"></a><small>222.</small>&nbsp;He who checks rising anger as a charioteer checks a rolling chariot, him I call a true charioteer. Others only hold the reins.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-223"></a><small>223.</small>&nbsp;Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-224"></a><small>224.</small>&nbsp;Speak the truth; yield not to anger; when asked, give even if you only have a little. By these three means can one reach the presence of the gods.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-225"></a><small>225.</small>&nbsp;Those sages who are inoffensive and ever restrained in body, go to the Deathless State, where, having gone, they grieve no more.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-226"></a><small>226.</small>&nbsp;Those who are ever vigilant, who discipline themselves day and night, and are ever intent upon Nibbāna — their defilements fade away.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-227"></a><small>227.</small>&nbsp;O Atula! Indeed, this is an ancient practice, not one only of today: they blame those who remain silent, they blame those who speak much, they blame those who speak in moderation. There is none in the world who is not blamed.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-228"></a><small>228.</small>&nbsp;There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praised.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-229"></a><small>229.</small>&nbsp;But the man whom the wise praise, after observing him day after day, is one of flawless character, wise, and endowed with knowledge and virtue.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-230"></a><small>230.</small>&nbsp;Who can blame such a one, as worthy as a coin of refined gold? Even the gods praise him; by Brahmā, too, is he praised.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-231"></a><small>231.</small>&nbsp;Let a man guard himself against irritability in bodily action; let him be controlled in deed. Abandoning bodily misconduct, let him practice good conduct in deed.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-232"></a><small>232.</small>&nbsp;Let a man guard himself against irritability in speech; let him be controlled in speech. Abandoning verbal misconduct, let him practice good conduct in speech.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-233"></a><small>233.</small>&nbsp;Let a man guard himself against irritability in thought; let him be controlled in mind. Abandoning mental misconduct, let him practice good conduct in thought.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-234"></a><small>234.</small>&nbsp;The wise are controlled in bodily action, controlled in speech and controlled in thought. They are truly well-controlled.</p>
