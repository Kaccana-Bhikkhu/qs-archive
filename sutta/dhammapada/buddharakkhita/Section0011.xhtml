  <p class="sgc-2"><img alt="" src="../Images/sun.png" /><br /></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-146"></a><small>146.</small>&nbsp;When this world is ever ablaze, why this laughter, why this jubilation? Shrouded in darkness, will you not see the light?</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-147"></a><small>147.</small>&nbsp;Behold this body — a painted image, a mass of heaped up sores, infirm, full of hankering — of which nothing is lasting or stable!</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-148"></a><small>148.</small>&nbsp;Fully worn out is this body, a nest of disease, and fragile. This foul mass breaks up, for death is the end of life.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-149"></a><small>149.</small>&nbsp;These dove-colored bones are like gourds that lie scattered about in autumn. Having seen them, how can one seek delight?</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-150"></a><small>150.</small>&nbsp;This city (body) is built of bones, plastered with flesh and blood; within are decay and death, pride and jealousy.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-151"></a><small>151.</small>&nbsp;Even gorgeous royal chariots wear out, and indeed this body too wears out. But the Dhamma of the Good does not age; thus the Good make it known to the good.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-152"></a><small>152.</small>&nbsp;The man of little learning grows old like a bull. He grows only in bulk, but, his wisdom does not grow.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-153"></a><small>153.</small>&nbsp;Through many a birth in saṁsāra have I wandered in vain, seeking the builder of this house (of life). Repeated birth is indeed suffering!</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-154"></a><small>154.</small>&nbsp;O house-builder, you are seen! You will not build this house again. For your rafters are broken and your ridgepole shattered. My mind has reached the Unconditioned; I have attained the destruction of craving.<sup><a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn-13">13</a></sup></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-155"></a><small>155.</small>&nbsp;Those who in youth have not led the holy life, or have failed to acquire wealth, languish like old cranes in the pond without fish.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-156"></a><small>156.</small>&nbsp;Those who in youth have not lead the holy life, or have failed to acquire wealth, lie sighing over the past, like worn out arrows (shot from) a bow.</p>
