  <p class="sgc-2"><img alt="" src="../Images/sun.png" /><br /></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-100"></a><small>100.</small>&nbsp;Better than a thousand useless words is one useful word, hearing which one attains peace.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-101"></a><small>101.</small>&nbsp;Better than a thousand useless verses is one useful verse, hearing which one attains peace.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-102"></a><small>102.</small>&nbsp;Better than reciting a hundred meaningless verses is the reciting of one verse of Dhamma, hearing which one attains peace.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-103"></a><small>103.</small>&nbsp;Though one may conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle, yet he indeed is the noblest victor who conquers himself.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="verse-104-105"></a><small>104–105.</small>&nbsp;Self-conquest is far better than the conquest of others. Not even a god, an angel, Māra or Brahmā can turn into defeat the victory of a person who is self-subdued and ever restrained in conduct.<sup><a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn-12">12</a></sup></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-106"></a><small>106.</small>&nbsp;Though month after month for a hundred years one should offer sacrifices by the thousands, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds that honor is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-107"></a><small>107.</small>&nbsp;Though for a hundred years one should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds, that worship is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-108"></a><small>108.</small>&nbsp;Whatever gifts and oblations one seeking merit might offer in this world for a whole year, all that is not worth one fourth of the merit gained by revering the Upright Ones, which is truly excellent.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-109"></a><small>109.</small>&nbsp;To one ever eager to revere and serve the elders, these four blessing accrue: long life and beauty, happiness and power.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-110"></a><small>110.</small>&nbsp;Better it is to live one day virtuous and meditative than to live a hundred years immoral and uncontrolled.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-111"></a><small>111.</small>&nbsp;Better it is to live one day wise and meditative than to live a hundred years foolish and uncontrolled.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-112"></a><small>112.</small>&nbsp;Better it is to live one day strenuous and resolute than to live a hundred years sluggish and dissipated.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-113"></a><small>113.</small>&nbsp;Better it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of things.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-114"></a><small>114.</small>&nbsp;Better it is to live one day seeing the Deathless than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Deathless.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-115"></a><small>115.</small>&nbsp;Better it is to live one day seeing the Supreme Truth than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Supreme Truth.</p>
