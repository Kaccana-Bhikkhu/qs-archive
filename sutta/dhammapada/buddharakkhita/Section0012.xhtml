  <h2 id="heading_id_13" title="12. Attavagga: The Self (157-166)"><small>12.</small> Attavagga: <i>The&nbsp;Self</i></h2>

  <p class="sgc-2"><img alt="" src="../Images/sun.png" /><br /></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-157"></a><small>157.</small>&nbsp;If one holds oneself dear, one should diligently watch oneself. Let the wise man keep vigil during any of the three watches of the night.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-158"></a><small>158.</small>&nbsp;One should first establish oneself in what is proper; then only should one instruct others. Thus the wise man will not be reproached.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-159"></a><small>159.</small>&nbsp;One should do what one teaches others to do; if one would train others, one should be well controlled oneself. Difficult, indeed, is self-control.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-160"></a><small>160.</small>&nbsp;One truly is the protector of oneself; who else could the protector be? With oneself fully controlled, one gains a mastery that is hard to gain.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-161"></a><small>161.</small>&nbsp;The evil a witless man does by himself, born of himself and produced by himself, grinds him as a diamond grinds a hard gem.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-162"></a><small>162.</small>&nbsp;Just as a single creeper strangles the tree on which it grows, even so, a man who is exceedingly depraved harms himself as only an enemy might wish.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-163"></a><small>163.</small>&nbsp;Easy to do are things that are bad and harmful to oneself. But exceedingly difficult to do are things that are good and beneficial.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-164"></a><small>164.</small>&nbsp;Whoever, on account of perverted views, scorns the Teaching of the Perfected Ones, the Noble and Righteous Ones — that fool, like the bamboo, produces fruits only for self destruction.<sup><a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn-14">14</a></sup></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-165"></a><small>165.</small>&nbsp;By oneself is evil done; by oneself is one defiled. By oneself is evil left undone; by oneself is one made pure. Purity and impurity depend on oneself; no one can purify another.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-166"></a><small>166.</small>&nbsp;Let one not neglect one’s own welfare for the sake of another, however great. Clearly understanding one’s own welfare, let one be intent upon the good.</p>
