  <p>As a great religious classic and the chief spiritual testament of early Buddhism, <i class="sgc-2">the Dhammapada cannot be gauged in its true value by a single reading, even if that reading is done carefully and reverentially.</i> It yields its riches only through repeated study, sustained reflection, and most importantly, through the application of its principles to daily life. Thence it might be suggested to the reader in search of spiritual guidance that the Dhammapada be used as a manual for contemplation. <b class="sgc-3">After his initial reading, he would do well to read several verses or even a whole chapter every day, slowly and carefully, relishing the words.</b> He should reflect on the meaning of each verse deeply and thoroughly, investigate its relevance to his life, and apply it as a guide to conduct. If this is done repeatedly, with patience and perseverance, it is certain that the Dhammapada will confer upon his life a new meaning and sense of purpose. Infusing him with hope and inspiration, gradually it will lead him to discover a freedom and happiness far greater than anything the world can offer.</p>
