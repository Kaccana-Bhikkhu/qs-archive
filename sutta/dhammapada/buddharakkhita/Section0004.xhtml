  <p class="sgc-2"><img alt="" src="../Images/sun.png" /><br /></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-44"></a><small>44.</small>&nbsp;Who shall overcome this earth, this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and gods? Who shall bring to perfection the well-taught path of wisdom as an expert garland-maker would his floral design?</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-45"></a><small>45.</small>&nbsp;A striver-on-the path shall overcome this earth, this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and gods. The striver-on-the-path shall bring to perfection the well-taught path of wisdom, as an expert garland-maker would his floral design.<sup><a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn-7">7</a></sup></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-46"></a><small>46.</small>&nbsp;Realizing that this body is like froth, penetrating its mirage-like nature, and plucking out Māra’s flower-tipped arrows of sensuality, go beyond sight of the King of Death!</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-47"></a><small>47.</small>&nbsp;As a mighty flood sweeps away the sleeping village, so death carries away the person of distracted mind who only plucks the flowers (of pleasure).</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-48"></a><small>48.</small>&nbsp;The Destroyer brings under his sway the person of distracted mind who, insatiate in sense desires, only plucks the flowers (of pleasure).</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-49"></a><small>49.</small>&nbsp;As a bee gathers honey from the flower without injuring its color or fragrance, even so the sage goes on his alms-round in the village.<sup><a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn-8">8</a></sup></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-50"></a><small>50.</small>&nbsp;Let none find fault with others; let none see the omissions and commissions of others. But let one see one’s own acts, done and undone.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-51"></a><small>51.</small>&nbsp;Like a beautiful flower full of color but without fragrance, even so, fruitless are the fair words of one who does not practice them.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-52"></a><small>52.</small>&nbsp;Like a beautiful flower full of color and also fragrant, even so, fruitful are the fair words of one who practices them.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-53"></a><small>53.</small>&nbsp;As from a great heap of flowers many garlands can be made, even so should many good deeds be done by one born a mortal.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-54"></a><small>54.</small>&nbsp;Not the sweet smell of flowers, not even the fragrance of sandal, <i>tagara,</i> or jasmine blows against the wind. But the fragrance of the virtuous blows against the wind. Truly the virtuous man pervades all directions with the fragrance of his virtue.<sup><a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn-9">9</a></sup></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-55"></a><small>55.</small>&nbsp;Of all the fragrances — sandal, <i>tagara,</i> blue lotus and jasmine — the fragrance of virtue is the sweetest.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-56"></a><small>56.</small>&nbsp;Faint is the fragrance of <i>tagara</i> and sandal, but excellent is the fragrance of the virtuous, wafting even amongst the gods.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-57"></a><small>57.</small>&nbsp;Māra never finds the path of the truly virtuous, who abide in heedfulness and are freed by perfect knowledge.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-58"></a><small>58.</small>&nbsp;Upon a heap of rubbish in the road-side ditch blooms a lotus, fragrant and pleasing.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-59"></a><small>59.</small>&nbsp;Even so, on the rubbish heap of blinded mortals the disciple of the Supremely Enlightened One shines resplendent in wisdom.</p>
