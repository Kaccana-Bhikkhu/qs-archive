  <p class="sgc-2"><img alt="" src="../Images/sun.png" /><br /></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-33"></a><small>33.</small>&nbsp;Just as a fletcher straightens an arrow shaft, even so the discerning man straightens his mind — so fickle and unsteady, so difficult to guard.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-34"></a><small>34.</small>&nbsp;As a fish when pulled out of water and cast on land throbs and quivers, even so is this mind agitated. Hence should one abandon the realm of Māra.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-35"></a><small>35.</small>&nbsp;Wonderful, indeed, it is to subdue the mind, so difficult to subdue, ever swift, and seizing whatever it desires. A tamed mind brings happiness.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-36"></a><small>36.</small>&nbsp;Let the discerning man guard the mind, so difficult to detect and extremely subtle, seizing whatever it desires. A guarded mind brings happiness.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-37"></a><small>37.</small>&nbsp;Dwelling in the cave (of the heart), the mind, without form, wanders far and alone. Those who subdue this mind are liberated from the bonds of Māra.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-38"></a><small>38.</small>&nbsp;Wisdom never becomes perfect in one whose mind is not steadfast, who knows not the Good Teaching and whose faith wavers.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-39"></a><small>39.</small>&nbsp;There is no fear for an awakened one, whose mind is not sodden (by lust) nor afflicted (by hate), and who has gone beyond both merit and demerit.<sup><a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn-6">6</a></sup></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-40"></a><small>40.</small>&nbsp;Realizing that this body is as fragile as a clay pot, and fortifying this mind like a well-fortified city, fight out Māra with the sword of wisdom. Then, guarding the conquest, remain unattached.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-41"></a><small>41.</small>&nbsp;Ere long, alas! this body will lie upon the earth, unheeded and lifeless, like a useless log.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-42"></a><small>42.</small>&nbsp;Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy, or a hater to a hater, an ill-directed mind inflicts on oneself a greater harm.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-43"></a><small>43.</small>&nbsp;Neither mother, father, nor any other relative can do one greater good than one’s own well-directed mind.</p>
