  <p class="sgc-2"><img alt="" src="../Images/sun.png" /><br /></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-256"></a><small>256.</small>&nbsp;Not by passing arbitrary judgments does a man become just; a wise man is he who investigates both right and wrong.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-257"></a><small>257.</small>&nbsp;He who does not judge others arbitrarily, but passes judgment impartially according to the truth, that sagacious man is a guardian of law and is called just.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-258"></a><small>258.</small>&nbsp;One is not wise because one speaks much. He who is peaceable, friendly and fearless is called wise.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-259"></a><small>259.</small>&nbsp;A man is not versed in Dhamma because he speaks much. He who, after hearing a little Dhamma, realizes its truth directly and is not heedless of it, is truly versed in the Dhamma.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-260"></a><small>260.</small>&nbsp;A monk is not an Elder because his head is gray. He is but ripe in age, and he is called one grown old in vain.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-261"></a><small>261.</small>&nbsp;One in whom there is truthfulness, virtue, inoffensiveness, restraint and self-mastery, who is free from defilements and is wise — he is truly called an Elder.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-262"></a><small>262.</small>&nbsp;Not by mere eloquence nor by beauty of form does a man become accomplished, if he is jealous, selfish and deceitful.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-263"></a><small>263.</small>&nbsp;But he in whom these are wholly destroyed, uprooted and extinct, and who has cast out hatred — that wise man is truly accomplished.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-264"></a><small>264.</small>&nbsp;Not by shaven head does a man who is indisciplined and untruthful become a monk. How can he who is full of desire and greed be a monk?</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-265"></a><small>265.</small>&nbsp;He who wholly subdues evil both small and great is called a monk, because he has overcome all evil.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-266"></a><small>266.</small>&nbsp;He is not a monk just because he lives on others’ alms. Not by adopting outward form does one become a true monk.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-267"></a><small>267.</small>&nbsp;Whoever here (in the Dispensation) lives a holy life, transcending both merit and demerit, and walks with understanding in this world — he is truly called a monk.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-268"></a><small>268.</small>&nbsp;Not by observing silence does one become a sage, if he be foolish and ignorant. But that man is wise who, as if holding a balance-scale accepts only the good.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-269"></a><small>269.</small>&nbsp;The sage (thus) rejecting the evil, is truly a sage. Since he comprehends both (present and future) worlds, he is called a sage.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-270"></a><small>270.</small>&nbsp;He is not noble who injures living beings. He is called noble because he is harmless towards all living beings.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="verse-271-272"></a><small>271–272.</small>&nbsp;Not by rules and observances, not even by much learning, nor by gain of absorption, nor by a life of seclusion, nor by thinking, “I enjoy the bliss of renunciation, which is not experienced by the worldling” should you, O monks, rest content, until the utter destruction of cankers (Arahantship) is reached.</p>
