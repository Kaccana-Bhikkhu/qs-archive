  <p class="sgc-2"><img alt="" src="../Images/sun.png" /><br /></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-209"></a><small>209.</small>&nbsp;Giving himself to things to be shunned and not exerting where exertion is needed, a seeker after pleasures, having given up his true welfare, envies those intent upon theirs.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-210"></a><small>210.</small>&nbsp;Seek no intimacy with the beloved and also not with the unloved, for not to see the beloved and to see the unloved, both are painful.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-211"></a><small>211.</small>&nbsp;Therefore hold nothing dear, for separation from the dear is painful. There are no bonds for those who have nothing beloved or unloved.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-212"></a><small>212.</small>&nbsp;From endearment springs grief, from endearment springs fear. For one who is wholly free from endearment there is no grief, whence then fear?</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-213"></a><small>213.</small>&nbsp;From affection springs grief, from affection springs fear. For one who is wholly free from affection there is no grief, whence then fear?</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-214"></a><small>214.</small>&nbsp;From attachment springs grief, from attachment springs fear. For one who is wholly free from attachment there is no grief, whence then fear?</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-215"></a><small>215.</small>&nbsp;From lust springs grief, from lust springs fear. For one who is wholly free from lust there is no grief; whence then fear?</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-216"></a><small>216.</small>&nbsp;From craving springs grief, from craving springs fear. For one who is wholly free from craving there is no grief; whence then fear?</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-217"></a><small>217.</small>&nbsp;People hold dear him who embodies virtue and insight, who is principled, has realized the truth, and who himself does what he ought to be doing.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-218"></a><small>218.</small>&nbsp;One who is intent upon the Ineffable (Nibbāna), dwells with mind inspired (by supramundane wisdom), and is no more bound by sense pleasures — such a man is called “One Bound Upstream.”<sup><a href="../Text/Notes.xhtml#fn-18">18</a></sup></p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-219"></a><small>219.</small>&nbsp;When, after a long absence, a man safely returns from afar, his relatives, friends and well-wishers welcome him home on arrival.</p>

  <p class="western"><a id="dhp-220"></a><small>220.</small>&nbsp;As kinsmen welcome a dear one on arrival, even so his own good deeds will welcome the doer of good who has gone from this world to the next.</p>
